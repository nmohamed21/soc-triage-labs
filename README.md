# SOC Triage Labs

This repository contains hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) triage labs demonstrating alert analysis, log correlation, and incident response workflows commonly used in blue team environments.

## Lab 01 – Authentication Log Triage
Performed Python-based analysis of authentication logs to identify potential brute-force login activity by correlating failed authentication events across multiple users and source IP addresses.

## Lab 02 – Network Traffic Triage
- Analyzed SMB and RPC network traffic using packet-level inspection
- Identified indicators associated with potential lateral movement
- Detected SAMR-based account enumeration activity
- Documented findings using SOC incident response and triage methodologies

## Lab 03 – SIEM Alert Triage
Configured and validated SIEM-based detection of Windows authentication failures using Wazuh. Conducted alert triage, event analysis, and incident documentation following standard SOC workflows.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Wireshark
- Wazuh SIEM
- Windows authentication-style logs

## Skills Demonstrated
- SOC alert triage and prioritization
